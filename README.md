This is a Core functionality boilerplate for SSM projects built on top of [WordPress Plugin Boilerplate](https://github.com/DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate). It simplifies the process of registration of custom post types, taxonomies and terms and adds some useful reusable features to work with internal WP entities.
